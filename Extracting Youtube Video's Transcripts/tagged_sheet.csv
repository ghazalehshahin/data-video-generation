0,Who pays the lowest taxes in the US?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXCGbAv8YPw,kXCGbAv8YPw,"This person on the left — she represents
the poorest 10 percent of Americans. And on the right — he is the very richest
10 percent. So let’s ask this group a simple question: What percentage of your income gets taxed? Most Americans pay multiple income taxes … to
the federal government, and state governments, and local governments. But a recent analysis by two economists added
up all the income taxes. And when you do that, the data shows that
poor people pay a very small part of their income to the government. And rich people pay more. This concept, of taxing the poor at a lower
rate — and taxing the rich more… this is called: progressive taxation. It’s how taxes work in most countries. But it’s also why some critics question
whether these people… … are getting away without paying their
fair share: ""The middle class and the poor that pay, if
anything, a lot less."" ""Why is it that 45 percent of the population
of this country is not contributing back to the rest?"" But now let’s add one more guy to this group of 10: This guy — he represents the 400 richest Americans. Billionaires. Billionaires don’t make most of their money
through typical income. So their income actually gets taxed at lower
rates than these less rich people. Now, you might be thinking, don’t billionaires
pay taxes in other ways? And the answer is yes. This is just the income tax, and there are
lots of other kinds of taxes in America. And this analysis, where this data came from? It looked at all of those taxes. And it shows that, when we add them all up... There actually is someone in this group who
might not be paying their fair share. Let's go back to our first chart, with these
11 people. Remember, this is just the income tax. What happens when we add in all the other
taxes? Well, let’s look at another kind of tax:
Corporate and property taxes. These are the taxes we pay on the things we
own: Usually businesses, and property, and the money we make on them... Usually, rich people own more things. So these corporate and property taxes hit
them the hardest. Rich people also tend to be from rich families. And when they inherit a lot of money, the
government taxes them. This is called an estate tax. Put these taxes together, and it’s clear
that they place a much heavier burden on the rich -- including billionaires. Add these back onto the income taxes, and it looks like the rich really do pay way more than the poor. But now let's talk about another tax. This one's buried in your paystub. Look closely, and you'll see something called
a Medicare tax and a Social Security tax. Sometimes paystubs call them FICA. Anyway, combined, these are called payroll
taxes. Medicare and Social Security are two really
important programs: they provide health care and a modest income for when we get old and
retire. But they’re also expensive. Which is why we have these payroll taxes -- separate from the income tax -- to pay for them. So on your paycheck, you'll notice that you're
taxed 7.65 percent in payroll taxes. And your company is supposed to pay another
7.65 percent on your behalf. But economists have found that, in practice,
the way companies pay their part of the payroll tax... is by just paying workers less. So in reality, many workers pay nearly the full 15.3
percent toward this tax. And everyone is on the hook for the same percentage. But the wealthy? Once someone earns more than about $130,000
a year … the money they make beyond that isn't subject to the Social Security tax. It's capped. That means the rich pay a really small portion
of their income toward payroll taxes. And poor people and the middle class pay way
more. Add payroll taxes onto the chart, and it starts
to flatten out. The last type of taxes we’re going to look
at are the taxes we pay when we buy stuff. For example, let's say you're looking to buy
a t-shirt. When you check out, you pay a sales tax, which
is a percentage of its cost. And sales taxes apply to most things: Furniture. Toilet paper. Laundry detergent. For some items, like beer and gasoline, there
are additional taxes that get incorporated into the price tag ... before you even get
to the store. These are called consumption taxes. And we all pay the same rate on the things
we buy, regardless of how rich we are. You might think that, since rich people usually
buy more things — and more expensive things… they pay a larger percentage of their income
toward these taxes. But, relative to how much money they have,
the stuff they buy, and the taxes they pay on that stuff, take up a relatively small
portion of their income. Meanwhile, everyone, even people with almost no money, needs to buy certain basic things to survive. And for poor people, those basic things and the taxes that come with them cost them almost everything they earn. So if we chart how much of their income each
of these people pays in consumption taxes... … we can see that poor people pay a much larger
portion. When we put these taxes together… Suddenly we see a big change. The chart shows us that this line, from before,
is a lie. That America’s tax system as a whole, isn’t
very progressive. Instead, it’s mostly flat. Poor people pay about the same portion of
their income in taxes as rich people. And this guy — this billionaire — is paying
a smaller portion than everyone else. Even the poorest. If you look at just certain types of taxes, it’s natural to assume that rich people pay a bigger tax burden in the US, and that poor people aren’t exactly paying their fair share. But a more complete look at the bigger picture,
challenges that. And it suggests that, if we’re looking for
a group that isn’t paying their fair share, we might be looking on the wrong end.","Economy, Taxation, Inequality, Government, Wealth",,,,,,,,"Economical, Social, Political"

2,Did the US reopen faster than other countries? - BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbtdGupA5OM,RbtdGupA5OM,nowhere in the world has escaped the coronavirus but why months into the pandemic are cases still surging in the united states the first spike came in early april driven by infections around new york as well as hot spots in the deep south this second surge has now affected almost every part of the country personally i think that we've opened up too soon we thought we saw a light at the end of the tunnel but it turned out that was a train despite the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly [Music] so when did other countries lift their restrictions let's look at daily new cases in germany italy and the uk and compare those to the us germany eased its lockdowns in late april followed by italy in early may and the uk waited until mid-june what they have in common is all three countries were well below a recommended benchmark of less than four daily new cases per 100 000 residents the u.s saw a slight decline in case numbers but was not close to that benchmark when the first states let their lockdowns expire on april 30th nor by may 15th when half of americans lived in states which had eased restrictions and by may 31st when 47 states representing 90 of the population had lifted lockdowns cases were still above that dotted line in mid-june as cases in europe continued to decline they surged in america u.s politicians claimed it was down to more testing yeah when we do 85 000 tests we're going to have more we're doing 40 000 tests we're going to have less positives after a slow start the us is testing more than other countries including germany italy and the uk we're definitely testing more and finding more cases than before but the key issue is that the percent positivity of tests is also rising telling you that the cases are outstripping our increase in testing meaning the outbreak is expanding experts say fewer than five percent of tests should come back positive for a country to be confident about the true extent of the outbreak that's represented by the yellow line on this chart germany italy and the uk are all to the left with positive results making up fewer than five percent of all tests however the u.s is just to the right of the line and the danger zone marked red which means the virus is not contained and reopening is risky lab confirmed cases public health at six feet cases down wearing a mask it's hard to compare the whole of the u.s to other countries so let's see how individual states arizona florida and texas beared on these measures we want to reinvigorate our economy well two out of three were in fact below the recommended threshold for new cases at the time they reopened that's good however when we look at the positivity rate all three were well above that 5 benchmark when they reopened in the spring that indicates a problem with testing early on experts told officials at least 500 000 tests per day were required to safely reopen the country that's around 150 tests per 100 000 people arizona florida and texas were far below that level when they eased restrictions in the spring and have only now reached adequate testing levels but that was too late look at the positivity rates in the three states by july there are in fact five benchmarks a state or region should meet before lifting restrictions besides low infection rates robust testing and a small share of positive results they also include a two-week drop in cases and having enough icu beds arizona failed four out of those five benchmarks when it reopened texas 3 and florida 2. so how did other countries prepare for potential surging cases as they reopened well germany for example told its regions that 50 new cases per 100 000 residents in a week would trigger new restrictions and return to lockdown life if the u.s applied that same benchmark of 50 cases per 100 000 people we see that 38 of the 50 states should return to lockdown now nine states have introduced partial restrictions as of july 14th and 13 states have paused a reopening transition but can others learn the lessons from other countries who for now got the outbreak under control,"Pandemic, Coronavirus, Health, Politics, Testing",,,,,,,,"Political, Health"

5,Global Wealth Inequality - What you never knew you never knew,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWSxzjyMNpU,uWSxzjyMNpU,"People are talking a lot about
inequality these days... about the fact that the richest 1% have so much more than everybody
else. But most of the focus seems to be on the United States and it strikes me
that the same story needs to be told about global inequality, too. So I did some research, and this is what I found from reliable sources
like the UN. It turns out, that while the US is   totally out of whack, things are actually
way worse for the planet as a whole. Let's start with this graph a perfectly
even distribution of wealth among all living people, with everyone divided into five equal
groups. Now, let's show how much each group actually has   Shocking, right? 80% percent of the world's people barely have any wealth, it's
hard to even see them on the chart. Meanwhile, the richest 2%, they have more wealth than
half of the rest of the world. Let's look at this chart another way. Let's
take the whole world's population all 7 billion of us and reduce it to
just a representative 100 individuals. Here they are, poorest people on the left, richest
people on the right. Now let's show how the world's total
wealth roughly 223 trillion dollars is distributed. The vast majority have practically nothing Nothing with which to educate their children, nothing with which to pay for basic
medicines. While the richest 1%... they've accumulated 43% of our world's
wealth. The bottom 80%, meanwhile - that's 8 out of every 10 people - have just 6% between
them. But even this doesn't show how extreme things have
become. The richest 300 people on Earth have the same wealth as the poorest 3
billion So the number of people it takes to
fill a mid-size commercial aircraft have more wealth than the populations of India, China,
the US, and Brazil combined   We can also see this inequality geographically,
with a huge and growing gap between a few rich places versus the majority of the
world.   For most of history, things were much more equal. 200 years ago, rich countries were only 3 times richer than poor countries. By the
end of colonialism in the 1960s, they were 35 times richer. Today, they're about 80 times richer. Rich countries try to compensate for this
by giving aid to poor countries - about 130 billion dollars each year. That's a
lot of money. So then why does the wealth gap keep getting
bigger? One reason I found is that large corporations
are taking more than 900 billion dollars out of poor countries each year through a form of tax avoidance called trade mispricing. On top of this, each year poor countries are
paying about 600 billion dollars in debt service to rich countries, on loans that have already
been paid off many times over. And then there's the money that poor countries
lose from trade rules imposed by rich countries to get access to more resources and cheaper
labor. Economists from the University of Massachusetts calculate that this costs poor countries about
500 billion dollars a year. All together, that's more than 2 trillion
dollars that flows from some of the poorest parts of the world to the richest, every year.
Rich governments like to say they're helping poor countries develop, but who's developing
who here? This makes me think that there's something
wrong with the basic rules of the global economy. It can't be right that the wealth of our
planet is becoming so concentrated in the hands of such a tiny number of people.
The only reasonable response, it seems to me, and our only hope, is to change the rules.","Inequality, Economy, Wealth-Distribution, Globalization, Poverty",,,,,,,,"Social, Economical"
6,"American segregation, mapped at day and night",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaPQN0aW47I,qaPQN0aW47I,"This was Levittown, Pennsylvania, shortly
after World War II. In a suburb that explicitly promised a
white-only neighborhood. And it wasn't some outlier. It was the prototypical suburb, built by the father of suburbia — Bill
Levitt — who created several suburbs around the US, all named Levittown. But one reason Levitt wanted a white-only
community was because the US government was subsidizing it — and that's what they wanted. They said they didn't want ""racially inharmonious
groups"" lowering property values. That's why Levitt didn't just sell cookie-cutter
houses. He sold a meticulously crafted, affordable,
utopian lifestyle. So as the courts integrated public spaces,
like schools, more and more white people fled to these suburbs. And these patterns are still the defining
characteristic of America's racial geography. But we now spend most of our time at work. It gets a lot more complicated. ""More than a million persons each year have
pulled up stakes in the city and turned commuter…"" Shortly after the first Levittown broke ground
in 1947 in Long Island, New York, about 80 percent of men still commuted the hour to
Manhattan. And while neighborhoods were getting deeply
segregated, these workplaces were getting more diverse. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned employment
discrimination. More companies explicitly said they were ""equal
opportunity employers."" And segregation within our workplaces declined. This meant the workplace was a crucial environment
for us to interact with people of other races. Except that's not exactly how it turned out. A few months ago, researchers at Cornell and
Penn State shared a dataset with me — and when I mapped it, it kind of blew my mind. This is a map of where people work in modern-day
Chicago. The taller an area,
the more people there are. But now, let's color in each neighborhood
by the percentage of white people. You can see the city centers are pretty diverse. But, now, here's what happens when they go
home. What's even more astounding is what happens
when we map people of color. Here's where black people work in Chicago. Again, they're concentrated in diverse city
centers. But when black workers go home, they go to
very segregated neighborhoods, clustered in the poorer areas. And we can see the same patterns in DC. Detroit. Philadelphia. Pretty much everywhere in the US. These maps shows just how stubborn residential
segregation is. But they also show what looks like a glimmer of
hope for integration: cities are remarkably diverse during the work day. This got researchers interested in looking
closer at what's at work. Let's look at how segregation has changed
in recent year. From 2000 to 2010, residential segregation
between black and white people got slightly better. For the most part, segregation just mostly plateaued for all racial groups. But when researchers looked at how segregation
changed during the day, when we're at work, they found that segregation increased slightly
across all racial groups. When we zoom in some more to the company level, we can see a bit more of what's actually happening. Researchers at Stanford and Harvard found,
within a company, segregation levels have gone down very little. In other words, we're exposed to about as
much diversity now... as we were a generation ago. But there are a lot more people of color now
than there were in 1980. So what's going on? Well, they aren't being more represented at
these white-majority companies, which would look like this. Rather, they are getting
opportunities at companies that are mostly non-white, over here. So this means that, when we look at this from
a company level, segregation has actually gotten worse than a generation ago. Of course, some places are pretty diverse. So researchers looked at what kinds of places
actually have less segregation during the day. But they found that, if a place is diverse
during the daytime, it's likely not because people of all races are working alongside
each other. Rather, it's likely because most of the higher
status workers, like managers, are white. and the lower-status workers, like janitors,
are people of color. American policies engineered our segregated
homes. But work — where we spend most of our time? Many thought that could be a space where we
form meaningful relationships with people of other racial backgrounds. That hasn't quite happened. And we can see it in the most personal parts
of our lives. In 2014, the Public Religion Research Institute
asked Americans to list the people with whom they ""discussed important matters"" in
the past six months. In other words, our friends. Most Hispanic people had friends of other
races. About one in three black people did, too. But 75 percent of white people only had
white friends. In short, we may be exposed to diverse spaces, but we still live very segregated lives. ""The whole trouble with this integration business is that in the end it probably will end up with mixing, socially.""","Racism, Segregation, Suburbia, Employment, Diversity",,,,,,,,"Social, Economical"
7,How climate change makes hurricanes worse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0TCrGtTEQM,_0TCrGtTEQM,"""Thirty inches of rain ahead."" ""Could climate change be fueling  the history-making nature of this storm?"" We know that humanity's carbon footprint has shifted the baseline conditions of the climate, the context in which every weather event takes place. But trying to isolate the human influence from everything else that is going on can be really hard, especially for hurricanes, or what scientists call ""tropical cyclones."" They're super complex and the quality of the historical data we have for them isn't great. We do have physics, though. Hurricanes are driven by the transfer of heat from the sea to the air  through evaporation. The storm's maximum possible wind speed, or its potential intensity, depends in part on how warm the ocean is And of course, we're warming the ocean. So researchers expect intense tropical cyclones to become frequent if we continue to warm the planet. ""That's one place I think you'd find a very strong consensus among scientists who study the connection between hurricanes and climate, that the frequency of the high-end events will probably go up."" And that shows up in climate models. This is from the intergovernmental panel on climate change It summarizes the computer model results for tropical cyclones near the end of this century, compared to today. The first bar represents the total number of tropical cyclones globally. That's projected to go down a bit. But the second bar represents the  frequency of the most intense storms, categories four and five, and the models show those increasing And that's bad news because those are the storms that cause the most damage and the biggest loss of life. Now when they try to look at specific regions, it gets really messy. In the North Atlantic, for example, the models show category four and five storms maybe increasing by 200% or maybe decreasing by 100%. So, yeah, the resolution of their simulations just isn't fine enough yet to give us good regional projections, even if they expect more intense storms globally. But there's another really clear consistent result here - this fourth bar, it represents the amount of rain that hurricanes will bring and that's going up. Not just for our Atlantic coast, but for the Pacific coast of North America, the western Pacific, the south Pacific, and the Indian Ocean, everywhere. The hurricanes of the future will be wetter. So coastal cities will face freshwater flooding from the sky paired with storm surge from the sea, which is higher now because we are also causing sea levels to rise. And that trend of wetter storms isn't just for hurricanes. Heavy precipitation events from other types of storms have been increasing in The US and should continue to increase across the country. Even in places that might see less rain over the whole year, they'll get more days with really heavy precipitation. This comes down to basic physics too: warmer air can take up more water before it dumps it back down on us. All of this means global warming worsens floods like the kind that hit Houston, but it's not our destiny to hurt ourselves like this. It depends on what we choose to do now. We could rethink our infrastructure and regulations to minimize the damage, but unless we also start cutting our carbon emissions and shifting the world to clean energy, it's just going to get worse.","Climate, Hurricanes, Research, Flooding, Global-Warming",,,,,,,,"Environmental, Science"
8,"How America can leave fossil fuels behind, in one chart | 2020 Election",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfAXbGInwno,QfAXbGInwno,for more than ten thousand years the average global temperature didn't change by more than one degree celsius but then humans started burning fossil fuels around here global temperatures have risen about 1 degree celsius since pre-industrial times this is what that looks like so far storms have gotten more intense wildfires are more common and ancient glaciers are melting faster and faster and that's just one degree of warming without global action the world is on track to warm at least 3 degrees celsius by 2100 this would be catastrophic that's why most scientists agree that we need to limit global warming to this range between 1.5 and 2 degrees celsius carbon dioxide which is emitted when we burn fossil fuels accounts for most of the world's greenhouse gas emissions it's the main culprit behind climate change and to limit global warming to the degree that scientists are calling for we have to stop releasing it we have to decarbonize the us doesn't currently emit the most carbon dioxide of any country but as one of the oldest industrial powers it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country or region so america has a big role to play in decarbonizing but how is the u.s supposed to do that and is it actually possible if you want to get halfway there by 2030 you have to start now now going fast there is literally zero more time to waste dave writes about energy and climate for vox and he says the 2020 u.s election comes with fairly clear stakes if trump is re-elected that's it like there's no chance for 1.5 and probably all chances for two degrees are gone the united states will withdraw from the paris climate accord open up the coal mines new offshore oil and gas leasing program president trump doesn't have a climate policy and his re-election will most likely continue policies designed to boost the fossil fuel industry they'd increase carbon emissions instead of decreasing them and the effects would be felt globally you just can't have the world's second biggest economy opting out moving the opposite direction and expect the world to get there the other major candidate in the election does have a plan to address climate change and this part in particular is ambitious by 2050 the united states will be 100 clean energy economy biden has been convinced and pushed to the point that he's got a great climate plan what biden's plan doesn't get into are the details on how exactly the u.s would actually do that but there are people who have thought about what it might look like to decarbonize by 2050 and to understand that it helps to get a picture of where america's energy comes from and where it goes sorry my son nearly stepped on a snake do you want to say hi this is saul griffith he's a physicist and an engineer but this is how dave describes him probably the person who knows more about energy as it's used in the united states than any other human being a few years ago saul decided to make a model of america's energy use he ended up reading basically every available piece of data from the energy information administration department of transportation national highway transit authority census bureau of labor statistics and noaa and so we pull all of those together to build a very comprehensive picture of the u.s energy economy that picture of the u.s energy economy it looks like this if you're just looking at the whole thing at once it just looks like a big pile of spaghetti it's hard to make sense of but it just traces energy every unit of energy how does it enter the economy how is it used throughout the economy this kind of chart is called a sankey diagram and it's easier to understand in three sections these columns here on the left are the sources of all the energy used in the u.s like natural gas coal solar wind nuclear and oil this column in the middle is what those energy sources get converted into so a lot of it becomes electricity most oil becomes the fuel we use for transportation and here you can see how much natural gas energy is being used to generate electricity versus being used directly to power things like cooking stoves and over here on the right this is where all the energy is used broken down into incredible detail like how much energy is being used to light shopping malls in the u.s or how much energy is being used by vehicles driven for work so you start to get this incredibly detailed picture of all of the interconnections which is really really important when you do the next exercise but what happens if we decarbonize remember that carbon emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels this stuff and saul says that means that to decarbonize we just need to follow their path the first place that leads you is here with electricity and the energy we use to generate it the majority of which in the u.s comes from two kinds of fossil fuel natural gas and coal if the us wants to decarbonize it needs to stop getting electricity this way and to replace it with other decarbonized energy sources that means coal power plants gone gas power plants gone all electricity would come from renewable sources wind solar geothermal hydroelectric and biomass or nuclear energy decarbonizing the way we get electricity would be a huge investment but it would also only eliminate 20 percent of emissions and that's because electricity and energy are not exactly the same thing that doesn't solve the vehicle's emissions it doesn't solve your your heating emissions from using natural gas or fuel oil in your basement all these other parts of the economy draw their energy directly from fossil fuels like transportation we use oil for fuel and commercial and residential buildings where we use gas and oil for heat but saul says there's a kind of elegant solution to this you decarbonize these sectors by switching their energy source from here to here make all of it electric because we already have almost all the technology we need to do it heat pumps batteries electric vehicles wind turbines nuclear power plants as we know that that can work we know we can do electric cars we know we can do electric heat for nearly everything it's all in the end just about machines right we got a bunch of machines that use fossil fuel energy we need to replace them with machines that use clean electricity and so it really just comes down to a matter of industrial capacity how fast can you build machines there are some things we'd have a harder time decarbonizing air travel will rely on fossil fuels until alternative technologies get better and things like steel and concrete are really hard to manufacture without fossil fuels but if we decarbonized as much as possible with the technology that we have now it would end most of the us's carbon emissions this church shows the country's carbon emissions broken down by economic sector if electricity residential commercial and transportation were mostly decarbonized you'd have solved a lot of the problem all of this would be a huge undertaking and it needs to happen fast saul's research modeled different scenarios for the transition from fossil fuel-based machines to electric ones from a market-driven transition to carbon taxes to a much more direct and heavy-handed approach that would replace our machines with their electric counterparts very quickly and he found that because we've delayed action for so long none of these slower approaches will be enough if you went back to 2000 and started then you could just put like a modest carbon tax in place and it would have just eased us down over the course of 30 years or whatever but emissions kept rising and rising and rising so now to get where we need to go they gotta fall off a cliff and that means zero delay we're just talking about a level of industrial mobilization that none of us alive have seen it would look like what fdr did to prepare the us for war literally every single solitary fossil fuel machine that goes out of service is replaced by a clean energy alternative every furnace car you know factory name it nearly everyone is buying an electric vehicle nearly everyone is buying rooftop solar nearly every new power plant that comes online is industrial scale solar or industrial wind we need that level of effort to do a lot better than two degrees all of recorded human history has happened within an era of relative climate stability an era that's about to end but we still have control over what comes next and the global effort that'll require hinges in part on what the us decides to do america can decarbonize we have the technology to do it we have the resources the only question is whether we want to do it i have a 6 year old and 11 year old and i have to believe that's going to happen otherwise and i have to try to make that happen as far as long as possible because it's their future we're stealing by not doing it thanks for watching this episode of our 2020 election series we're focusing on the issues that matter most to

9,How online ratings make good schools look bad,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC3ZPgg0nds,WC3ZPgg0nds,"In the US, most kids go to school based
on where they live. That means, when families decide where to live, one big factor is: How good is the school in the neighborhood? So how do you figure that
out? Well, you could visit the school... See how the playground looks.... Or ask friends about it. But all of these seem so imprecise. Plus, it's kind of weird to
visit dozens of playgrounds. So, these days, you would probably Google the school. And you'll almost certainly end up on this website: GreatSchools.org.
GreatSchools is a nonprofit school ratings website. They provide a number rating for almost every public school in America. The worst schools are a 1, and
the best schools are a 10. There are other websites and organizations that rate schools, but GreatSchools is the big one. Well, we dug into the data to find out. And what we found, is that this score often ends up showing something other than how good a school is. GreatSchools started in the late 1990s. They visited schools around the San Francisco Bay Area, and talked to each school's principal. But that method of profiling schools wasn't exactly scalable. They couldn't go visit every single school in the country. That would be prohibitively expensive; it was hard enough as it was. Matt Barnum is a reporter at Chalkbeat, a site that covers education. He helped us report
this story. Going to every single school was just not a sustainable model. Then, in 2001, something huge happened for GreatSchools. Congress passed a national
education law called ""No Child Left Behind."" No Child Left Behind required
schools to give state standardized tests, each year, in grades three through eight, to figure out how many of them met a standard called ""proficiency."" ""Proficiency"" is basically each US state's standard for what kids should know at a certain grade level. So that gave them a lot of data to rate schools all across the country. After No Child Left Behind, GreatSchools had the numbers they could base their scores on. Today, they say this proficiency score is the biggest factor in the ratings it gives each elementary and middle school; accounting for about half the score. But when we start looking at GreatSchools' data, we notice something. Here are basically all the public elementary and middle schools in Denver and a few of its suburbs. With the help of journalists at Chalkbeat, we sorted them by the percentage of low-income students in each school. These schools have more low-income students, and these schools have fewer. Now, let's highlight the schools that got a GreatSchools rating of at least a 7, which is what they consider above average. You can see that almost all of these better-rated schools are more affluent. And this is true in basically every city from San Francisco to Detroit. And this correlation also appears when
we sort these schools by racial demographics. Here's Denver again. The schools on the left have more black and hispanic students, and the schools on the right have fewer. So which schools got a rating
of 7 or above? It's schools with more white and Asian kids, who tend to come from more affluent neighborhoods. GreatSchools' ratings seem to confirm
something that many people already assume: Here's the problem: That's not necessarily true. And to understand why, we need to look at one of the big issues with measuring proficiency. America's neighborhoods are highly unequal. And when children show up
to school in affluent neighborhoods, that are mostly white and Asian, they're
better-prepared for school than children in poor, mostly black and Hispanic areas. So when we look at proficiency, we're actually often measuring how prepared these kids were coming in. Not what happens inside the school. So, if proficiency is more about measuring the student than the school, how could we
actually measure the school's performance? Well, another common way of measuring schools is to see how much a school helps a student improve. This is called a ""growth score."" Now, Growth is still just based on test scores, which not everyone is a fan of. But it's how many schools
prefer we measure them. The principals I talked to felt that it was more fair to judge them on growth. If you're a school that is serving a lot of students who
are coming in at a low level, you could be doing a great job with those students,
but it might not be showing up in proficiency. Not all states report growth scores, which is a problem in itself. But most do. And growth scores show that there are many low-income schools that are pretty good. Here's every Denver school again. And again, sorted by the percentage of low-income students. And now, if we highlight the schools that have an above-average growth score, which is data we got from GreatSchools' own website, we can see that there are lots of schools in poor neighborhoods that are very good at educating their students. And this is true in other cities, too: Like
Indianapolis... and Detroit. But in the GreatSchools rating system, growth only matters about half as much as proficiency does. Which is why these schools are rarely rated highly, even if they do a great job teaching students. We talked to GreatSchools. They said the important thing is that they give parents a ""broader picture of school quality,"" and that their site
helps ""underserved families"" make good choices. They also stressed that they've
actually changed the rating system to start considering growth, alongside
proficiency. And the data reflects this. But: There's still this really stark
correlation with race and class of students, but it is lower than what it
was before. That's not entirely their fault. Not every state reports growth scores. But even where growth scores are available, GreatSchools still weights proficiency a lot more. And that muddles the difference between two definitions of ""good"" schools: The ones that do the best job teaching students, and the ones that get kids who are already high-achieving, who tend to be from white and
affluent families. So maybe, the real question is: Which one do parents actually want?","Education, Neighborhoods, Socioeconomics, Legislation, Race",,,,,,,,"Social, Political"

11,The 'duck curve' is solar energy's greatest challenge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYLzss58CLs,YYLzss58CLs,"When you flip a light switch, you expect it
to work right? All of your appliances work, because your
power company has electricity ready to transmit. For a lot of customers. And utility companies have gotten really good
at anticipating that demand. But a rise in solar energy production is making
their jobs a bit more complex. Here's a chart that explains why. It's showing demand for electricity at any
given time of day. The power companies supply the least amount
of power overnight. Then, it ramps up in the morning. Everyone's woken up and business gets going. Then at sunset, energy demand peaks. Utility companies will update models like
this to operate as efficiently as possible. But the introduction of renewable energy,
particularly the solar energy, has started causing problems in these demand curves. In 2010, solar panel deployment really started
taking off. Most of those installations took place in
California, so researchers there started looking into it. They found that the sun produces the most
energy at mid-day. And when you factor in that new mid-day production,
your demand curve changes like this. Every year means new solar capacity, which
makes mid-day demand dip lower and lower. Researchers call this drop in demand the ""duck
curve."" From the grid managers' perspective, the people
whose job it is to constantly balance generation and demand, it looks like a drop in demand. That drop in demand creates two problems. The first has to do with the intense ramps
in the new chart. As the sun sets, solar energy production ends
just as the demand for energy typically peaks. Power plants then have to rapidly ramp up
production to compensate for that. Which is kind of hard to do with the current
fleet of power infrastructure. The second problem is economic. Say you have a couple of nuclear and coal
plants. Those plants are only economic when they are
running all the time, basically. They run around the clock. And if you have to turn them off at mid-day,
it completely screws up their economics and plus lots of utilities just have contracts
with those power plants to keep them running all the time. So that creates sort of an artificial floor. If solar generates too much power and there's
no use for it, there's no one to consume it, then grid managers just have to turn some
solar panels off. If they didn't, we could risk overloading
or even damaging the power grid. So we throw away some of that extra solar
energy. Effectively, what's happening is that solar
power is being wasted. That waste, curtailment, is the big challenge
moving forward for solar energy. If you want solar, eventually to power everything
or close to everything, you've gotta figure out some way of shifting it to the night time. Cause the sun's down during the night time. The more power that can be stored, the more
you can sort of let solar rip. While the grid managers figure out how to
serve this new supply and demand, this duck is the greatest challenge facing renewable
energy. Thank you for watching and thanks for Principal

12,Why America needs automatic voter registration,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd5Qs0fc_I0,Hd5Qs0fc_I0,"In Sweden, more than 82.6% of people over
18 turn out to vote in elections. 82.6%! In the U.S., just over half the voting age
population shows up to the polls. We’re getting our asses kicked by Denmark,
South Korea, the Netherlands and a whole host of other developed democracies. If we re-sort this chart to show what percent
of registered voters actually voted - we’re near the top of the list! The U.S. has a huge gap between the share
of people who can vote, and the share of people who actually do. But it turns out, a lot of these countries
are doing something really simple, that could make that gap disappear. If you take all 50 states, and rank them by
the share of eligible voters — that’s citizens over 18 who aren’t felons — that
actually voted in 2016, you can see a huge variation. Now let’s look at the states that let you
register when you show up to vote on election day. Notice something? The states with the highest turnout rates
all have it. All the states below the national
average— well, they don’t. Most of them make you register nearly a month
in advance. And there’s a whole host of reasons people
might not be registered - nearly a third of unregistered Americans say they intend
to and just haven’t gotten around to it, others say it’s inconvenient or they just
don’t know how. In Minnesota, 12% of the people who voted
in 2016 registered on election day. That’s 350,000 people. Maine, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Idaho
all had lots of people registering last-minute, too. Oregon has figured that out. Turnout increased nearly 4% from 2012 to 2016
— that's more than double than what we saw nationally. It’s no coincidence that in 2015 Oregon
became the first state to enact automatic voter registration - or AVR. Here’s how it works. Anyone who has an interaction with Oregon’s
Department of Motor Vehicles is automatically added to the list of registered voters, called
a voter roll. The state sends them postcards giving them
a chance to register with a party or decline to be registered. It changes the system from opt-in to opt-out. So a sixteen year old getting their
driver license will be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18. A new resident who changes their ID or
car registration will also be automatically registered In total, 272,000 people were registered this
way. And more than a third of them actually voted
in 2016. Of those voters, 37% of them were under 30. Compare that to the voters who were registered
through the traditional fill-out-the-vote--for method, and only 13% were under 30. AVR got more young people to come out on election
day. 13 states and Washington, DC have already
passed AVR legislation and will have it running by the 2020 election. It’ll have massive effects in California
alone, where there are nearly 7 million eligible people not registered to vote yet. Let’s go back to that chart with all the other
countries. These are the ones who have some form of automatic
voter registration. If the US implemented it nationally, we could
literally move up in the world. Plus, it’ll make our voting system more
secure and more accurate. Now when you move, you have to
re-register to vote. That creates duplicate registrations and makes
it harder for voter rolls to be kept updated. With AVR, your registration moves with you
- no duplicates. It’ll also be cheaper. Everything will be electronic and there will be millions
less registrations to process. But most importantly, it could automatically
register nearly 50 million Americans, who would then gets a chance to help decide how
the country should be run.","Elections, Democracy, Voting, Legislation, Politics",,,,,,,,Political
13,Weed is not more dangerous than alcohol,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGSzj7ztszI,zGSzj7ztszI,"Here's something most people don't know about
marijuana. Officially the U.S. federal government classifies it as a Schedule 1 drug. That is
the strictest classification they have, period. Full stop. That means the government thinks
marijuana is more dangerous than Schedule 2 drugs like cocaine or meth. It means they
think marijuana is on the same plane as heroin. About 3,000 people died from heroin overdoses
in 2010. You know how many people died directly of overdosing on marijuana? Zero. And I don't
mean zero in 2010, I mean zero in basically recorded human history. Which isn't to say
that smoking hay bales worth of pot is a good idea. It's not. But notice what I did there.
You hear that all the time. That's what we in the media business call the ""to be sure""
paragraph. It's the paragraph where we cover our asses. Almost everyone says that. Even the 
people who think legalizing marijuana is a great idea don't say it's a good thing. The
argument for legalizing pot isn't that pot is good, but that the war on pot is bad. But
there is a way in which legal pot could be  a huge public health win. I mean one of the
biggest public health wins we've had in decades, saving huge numbers of lives. Let's go back
to that drug schedule. There is one drug you won't see on there, even though it is a hell
of a lot more dangerous than pot or even cocaine. That's alcohol. The thing about alcohol is
it's really bad for you, lethally bad for you. I don't want to be a hypocrite here.
I enjoy a drink. But the evidence on this, you cannot run away from it. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention say there are 88,000 deaths each year attributable to alcohol.
About 25,000 of them are just direct overdoses. The numbers here are really amazing. A Columbia
University study found that being drunk increases the risk of a fatal accident 13-fold. Pot,
by contrast, increases the risk by less than 2-fold. Then there's all the other nasty stuff
alcohol leads to. It's a big contributor to violence, to crime, to addiction. It breaks
up families. It gives people cancer. It gives them liver failure. People forget this but
prohibition -- we laugh at it now but it was happening for a reason. People drank more
then and it was a scourge. So this is the question with legal pot: Would people use
it as a replacement or a complement to alcohol. If it's a replacement, it's a huge deal. Marijuana
is a lot safer to use than alcohol. People don't die from it. They rarely kill others
while on it. More marijuana and less alcohol means fewer deaths from intoxication, fewer
drunk driving fatalities, less crime, less violence. But if marijuana complements alcohol
rather than replacing it, then it's a problem. If it makes people for whatever reason, drink
more, then legalizing pot might actually make our alcohol problem worse. Now I'm going to
say something that kind of sucks: we actually don't know the answer here. There is encouraging
early evidence. In a survey of Canadian medical marijuana users, 41% said they replace alcohol
with marijuana. Another survey of California medical marijuana users found they drank less
than the national average. But those are medical marijuana users. They might be different from
the general population. People using marijuana for fun might have a very different relationship
to alcohol than people using marijuana because they're sick. But this isn't just something
we can study, it's something that we can affect, that we can change. Since we know that a lot
of people want to use some kind of mind-altering substance, we could arrange public policy to push them
towards the safer one. But right now, we can't because the federal government, against all
the evidence, thinks that marijuana is an incredibly, insanely dangerous substance with
absolutely no redeeming value under any circumstance.  What are they smoking?","Marijuana, Alcohol, Legislation, Health, Addiction",,,,,,,,Health
14,Data on hate crimes is terrible. Here's why.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8JNikQLGB4,u8JNikQLGB4,"I report on hate crimes for ProPublica.
You can think of a hate crime as a crime committed against somebody because of
who they are. Congress forced the Department of Justice to collect information on hate crimes starting in 1990. One of the greatest obligations
of this administration and of the Department of Justice is the guarantee
of civil rights for all Americans. Hate crimes cannot be tolerated in a free
society. but many police departments don't actually report their hate crimes to the FBI, assuming they even mark them down at all. We called every state agency charged with setting police academy training
standards and we asked if they provide training on hate crimes. And we sent more than 350 public records requests to law enforcement agencies across the country to see how they tracked hate crimes. From talking to experts we knew that hate
crime reporting was spotty at best, but the results of our investigation were
surprising even to me. Of the more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies that report hate crimes to the FBI, 88 percent of those just simply say they have none. Law enforcement agencies in seven of the 20 largest cities in the United
States either severely under report or don't report hate crimes at all. In the South, hate crimes are rarely reported. So, why is law enforcement failing to report hate crimes? Well, part of it is that officers get little to no training. What we found is that only 12 states have statutes that require police academies
to train on hate crimes. Another problem? Just... not doing it. Like at the Miami-Dade County Police Department, where officers said they just didn't fill out hate crime report forms. And a third problem: officials confuse state laws with
federal laws. Like in Alabama, where the state hate crime law doesn't cover homosexuality. and police officers there told us they wouldn't mark down a crime
with anti-gay bias as a hate crime. This is in spite of the fact that the federal
law asked them to. The problem is that people are being attacked. They're being attacked for who they are and our law enforcement agencies by and large don't appear to understand how to handle these crimes. The FBI is required to track this information for the rest of the country, but they
can't do it without support from local law enforcement
agencies.","Justice, Crime, Discrimination, Legislation, Investigation",,,,,,,,"Social, Political"
15,Americans Dodge $660 Billion in Taxes Each Year — And It’s Probably Getting Worse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxXOyYSHcfE,ZxXOyYSHcfE,"This is how much the United States
collects in taxes each year. But the IRS found that from 2008 to 2010 Americans paid only 81.7 percent of the taxes they really owed. Assuming that rate is the same today, That's about $660 billion dollars in tax
dodging each year. Here's the thing — The IRS is crumbling. Republicans won the
House of Representatives in 2010 and began aggressively cutting the agency's budget. The number of auditors on staff has decreased by nearly 35 percent and the IRS is also performing way fewer audits than it used to. We deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level to make them think twice about what they
are doing and why they are doing it. But the budget cuts haven't treated all
taxpayers equally. Audits of the rich have dropped dramatically but audits of the poorest Americans have stayed almost the same. Fewer audits literally means less enforcement of our tax laws. Experts told us if people think
they won't get caught cheating on their taxes, they're more likely to cheat. Here's how much money we're talking about even if people only cheat one
percentage point more. Or two percentage points. Or three percentage points. Or four percentage points as experts told us was totally possible. Putting that into perspective, The money lost with four percentage points more cheating is triple the Department of Education's budget for 2018. Hey, I'm Lucas Waldron and I make videos here at ProPublica.

since the start of 2018. The fire season has been dominating the news. “This has turned into another record-setting
fire season.” “Now the largest in state history.” “Really there’s no end in sight."" It’s hot. It’s dry. It’s windy. Just about everything on the ground is flammable. But there’s one thing that’s consistently
making wildfires in California worse and worse and worse: Us. At this point, even calling them “wild” fires
might be a misnomer, because most of them are not natural. Humans are responsible
for starting a whopping 84% of them. The northern California Carr fire for example,
was started by sparks from a car tire' rim. And in southern California, the Holy Fire just outside of
LA started after a suspected arson. These are just two of the fires currently
active in the state. So far in 2018 629,000 acres have burned. That’s nearly 3 times as much compared to
the same time period in 2017. What makes these fires so dangerous, damaging,
and therefore costly is that more human-made infrastructure is getting caught in the flames. This map highlights the parts of California
most prone to fires, and it’s no surprise that — yeah — that’s where these fires
are. But compare it to this map, which shows population density growth
projections. Put them together, and it’s clear: California’s population is growing out from urban centers directly into the areas at the highest risk for fire. Meanwhile, the state is spending more and more
to fight fires each year, as more people move into areas that put them
in harm’s way. “It’s up to all of us to protect and preserve
the forests we have.” So, since we made this mess worse, what can
we do? “‘That’s a good job!’ said Smokey the Bear.” Being mindful of how we spark these fires
is a good start, but the bigger problems contributing to this
— like man-made climate change — are unlikely to reverse. And despite the risks, humans keep moving
into these areas. “Fires creeping real real close to
some residences up here.” ""By 2050 another 645,000 houses will be built at areas at very high risk for wildfires."" We have the opportunity to get out of the
way of wildfires, and let nature run its course. But will we? “Only YOU can prevent forest fires.”","Wildfires, Environment, Population, Climate-Change, Infrastructure",,,,,,,,Environmental

24,How To End Poverty in 15 years' Hans Rosling - BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JiYcV_mg6A,5JiYcV_mg6A,this shows the percent in extreme poverty in the world 0% 50% and 100% and each uprise here represent 10 years here we are at 1900 and this is where we are today now I'm going to start all the way back 200 years ago the time of Napoleon 1800 what was the percentage of extreme poverty in the world then staggering 85% only a few was out of extreme poverty and then came the Industrial Revolution and did it improve H not much 1850 it was just down here to 80% and 1900 it came down to 70% and then further on to 1950 50 here this is when I was born just before I was 2 years old here 55% and we have to go all the way to 1970 to reach 50% the year when half the world population was out of extreme poverty and half of it was still in extreme poverty and then only in my adult life has it started to drop a little faster and I stopped here at 1990 when it was down to 35% now this year is not the first time the United Nation put a target a goal for extreme poverty the former goal was to half the extreme poverty from 1990 up to 2015 where we are now and many people at that time said that's mad that will never work so it's very exciting for you now to learn you know where is the last estimate where is 2015 and the estimate is oh I have to put a special stick here because it it's it's here 2015 this is where we are now and the estimate is 12 12 let me show you this fantastic Trend here you know how it went down from 85% coming slowly down a little faster down and then down here was the goal achieved well it's not easy to measure extreme poverty there is an uncertainty but there is no doubt that this trend is fast going down and that the last goal was indeed achieved however I'm a statistician and I know that just because you see a trend like that that doesn't mean that it will continue in the same direction it may level off like this because the last lap is often the toughest but on the other hand you can see that it's not impossible to achieve this new goal to end uh extreme poverty all together I'm going to show you where extreme poverty has been and how it has decreased this is the world and here are the population back in 1800 in each of the regions in Total 1 billion here is the J stick of income and I'm going to put down these people to show their incomes first Europe and they spread out here and then americaas on top of that then come Africa and on top of it the most populous region Asia including Australia and as I showed you before almost all people there were living in extreme poverty on all regions in the world now I'm going to show you what has happened I start the world and look with Industrial Revolution the population grew here and the incomes expanded here mainly because of increased income in Europe and America and then in the 20th century population continued to grow here and incomes increased even more here and there changed the whole pattern of the world it became a divided world the world view you grew up with with a rich West here and with poor Africa and Asia here but in the 1980s the amazing growth of China and the other tiger economy in Asia and India they start to get out of poverty they close this Gap and they are coming over on this side and the shape of the world change again and look now Africa is following I call them the lion economies of Africa and here we are today in a completely new shape of the world for those of you who still think about the world as the rich and the poor I'm going to give you a New Concept I'm going to give you a new term the middle what we have to do is to look at those who recently came from extreme poverty and into the middle to to learn what does it take to go from here to [Music] [Music] there there's the view from the top of the so it looks like that there is not too much wind on the top so is soaring uh and we can see that is controlling the the flight uh he has decided to uh let the the bird uh Glide you will have a look at uh his signs so now he tells him okay just Glide stay where you are so Jack Olivia is on the ground here spreading his arms which says just to keep gliding,"Poverty, History, Economics, Development, Statistics",,,,,,,,"Economical, Social, History"
25,Wealth Inequality in America,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM,QPKKQnijnsM,"there's a chart I saw recently that I can't get out of my head a Harvard Business professor and economist asked more than 5,000 Americans how they thought wealth was distributed in the United States this is what they said they thought it was dividing the country into five RUF groups of the top bottom and middle three 20% groups they asked people how they thought the wealth in this country was divided then he asked them what they thought was the ideal distribution and 92% that's at least nine out of ten of them said it should be more like this in other words more equitable than they think it is now that fact is telling admittedly the notion that most Americans know that the system is already skewed unfairly but what's most interesting to me is the reality compared to our perception the ideal is as far removed from our perception of reality as the actual distribution is from what we think exists in this country so ignore the ideal for a moment here's what we think it is again and here is the actual distribution shockingly skewed not only to the bottom 20 percent and the next 20 percent the bottom forty percent of Americans barely have any of the wealth I mean it's hard to even see them on the chart but the top 1% has more of the country's wealth than nine out of ten Americans believe the entire top 20 percent should have mind-blowing but let's look at it another way because I find this chart kind of difficult to wrap my head around instead let's reduce the 311 million Americans to just a representative one hundred people make it simple here they are teachers coaches firefighters construction workers engineers doctors lawyers some investment bankers a CEO maybe a celebrity or two now let's line them up according to their wealth poorest people on the Left wealthiest on the right just a steady row of folks based on their net worth will colour-code them like we did before based on which percent quintile they fall into now let's reduce the total wealth of the United States which was roughly fifty four trillion dollars in 2009 to this symbolic pile of cash and let's distribute it among our 100 Americans well here's socialism all the wealth of the country distributed equally we all know that won't work we need to encourage people to work and work hard to achieve that good ol American Dream and keep our country moving forward so here's that ideal we asked everyone about something like this curve this isn't too bad we've got some incentive as the wealthiest folks are now about 10 to 20 times better off than the poorest Americans but hey even the poor folks aren't actually poor since the poverty line has stayed almost entirely off the chart we have a super healthy middle class with a smooth transition into wealth and yes Republicans and Democrats alike chose this curve nine out of ten people 92 percent said this was a nice ideal distribution of America's wealth but let's move on this is what people think America's wealth distribution actually looks like not as equitable clearly but for me even this still looks pretty great yes the poorest 20 to 30 percent are starting to suffer quite a lot compared to the ideal and the middle class is certainly struggling more than they were while the rich and wealthy are making roughly a hundred times that of the poorest Americans and in about ten times that of the still healthy middle class sadly this isn't even close to the reality here is the actual distribution of wealth in America the poorest Americans don't even register they're down to pocket change and the middle class is barely distinguishable from the poor in fact even the rich between the top ten and twenty percentile are worse off only the top ten percent are better off and how much better off so much better off that the top two to five percent are actually off the chart at this scale and the top 1% this guy well his stack of money stretches 10 times higher than we can show here's his stack of cash rhe stacked all by itself this is the top 1% we've been hearing so much about so much green in his pockets that I have to give him a whole new column of his own because he won't fit on my chart 1% of America has 40% of all the nation's wealth the bottom 80% 8 out of every 10 people or 80 out of these hundred only has 7 percent between them and this has only gotten worse in the last 20 to 30 years while the richest 1% take home almost a quarter of the national income today in 1976 they took home only nine percent meaning their share of income has nearly tripled in the last thirty years the top 1% owned half the country stocks bonds and mutual funds the bottom 50% of Americans own only half a percent of these investments which means they aren't investing they're just scraping by I'm sure many of these wealthy people have worked very hard for their money but do you really believe that the CEO is working three hundred and eighty times harder than his average employee not his lowest paid employee not the janitor but the average earner in his company the average worker needs to work more than a month to earn what the CEO makes in one hour we certainly don't have to go all the way to socialism to find something that is fair for hardworking Americans we don't even have to achieve what most of us consider might be ideal all we need to do is wake up and realize that the reality in this country is not at all what we think it is you","Economy, Wealth-Distribution, Social-Issues, Politics,

26,Off by Trillions: The Reality of our Pension Problem (Pension Pursuit),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8KlJgaS42U,_8KlJgaS42U,we have now reached the final round of tension for suit the game were attacks payers young and old face off against their own state politicians and state employees the question we're going to conclude with is how big are pension liabilities to figure that out we have to first know how much money is owed to state employees in 2014 it was widely reported that state and local pension funds had three point six trillion dollars total assets the question becomes is this adequate to fund their pension obligations and if not by how much are pensions underfunded many researchers compile the self-reported disclosures of pension liabilities from state and local governments together they totaled four point eight trillion dollars in future obligations to retirees implying an unfunded liability of 1.2 trillion dollars but keep in mind that in their reporting the state and local governments are using overly optimistic assumptions about annual rates of return they're hoping risky investments pay off in a big way as we've discussed this is not the most appropriate way to report these pension obligations because these pension liabilities must be honored they are essentially equivalent to default free government debt consequently they should be measured using the rate of return on risk free bonds such as Treasury bonds a portfolio of Treasury bonds that has the same average maturity or duration as pension promises about 14 years as a rate of return of 2.8 percent when this approach Hoover Institution research shows that the pension liabilities total 7 trillion dollars so three point six trillion dollars in assets on his seven trillion dollars in liabilities results in an unfunded total liability of three point four trillion dollars which is almost three times higher than what's being reported and with a relatively flat stock market of the past few years the situation has surely worsened pension fund investment returns in 2015 and 2016 are likely far below the pipe dream return rates assumed in 2014 if you believe the three point six trillion dollars in assets are going to be managed well and generate really high returns you can hope that the profits from the risky investments will reduce the overall unfunded liability of three point four trillion dollars but there is no guarantee that this will happen and stating the liability with a built in assumption of hoped for risky returns is simply a poor measurement of a government promise so the key points to take away are one most media coverage of public pensions relies on flawed governmental accounting methods which are not consistent with well-established principles of financial economics to true liabilities are much higher than what the state reports reveal three and this doesn't even include health care obligations which are typically underfunded many entities don't set aside money yet still promise health coverage for their retirees covering the cost of care before they become eligible for Medicare and paying for coverage gaps once they're on Medicare in most cases they are not setting aside funds for this health coverage the bottom line you might have thought state and local governments or running balanced budgets but they are not they're making enormous future commitments to hard-working state employees without making proper provisions to honor them they're borrowing from tomorrow to pay for today future generations will have to pay more in taxes than they will receive in services does that sound fair a growing part of your city's expenditures is on pensions more and more of it is money that should have been contributed in the past and as cities and states get further and further behind it's only going to get worse visit pension Pursuit dot-com to learn more and see what you can do to help,"Finance, Government, Pensions, Economics, Retirement",,,,,,,,"Economical, Political"
27,The Numbers Game: How's The Middle Class Doing?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXI_ADnp22c&list=WL&index=7&t=22s,VXI_ADnp22c,[Music] I'm Russ Roberts what I'll be doing in this series is looking at just how easy it is to be fooled by numbers and data and how hard it is to measure economic life accurately we often have preconceived notions about how the world works and that makes it hard to look at numbers subjectively we tend to embrace studies or data that confirm our worldview while dismissing or avoiding evidence on the other side it's good to remember the insight of physicist Richard Fineman the first principle is you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool we're going to start with an important question how's the American economy been treating the middle class over the last 40 years wages and incomes are actually a lot higher now than in the 1970s but so are prices what we care about is what those wages can buy if prices have gone up more than wages that workers are actually worse off a worker today even with higher income has less purchasing power than a worker in the 1970s if too many things have gotten a lot more expensive everyone says the gains from all the economic growth of the last 40 years have gone to the rich those in the middle class have been stuck treading water at best making no progress since the 1970s is that true how do you find out it should be straightforward to take a measure of wages or income for the middle class or the average worker and corrected for inflation but it's not straightforward at all what I want to show you is just how sensitive the results can be to the different assumptions you can make let's start with Nobel laureate a New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wages for ordinary workers have in fact been stagnant since the 1970s here's Krugman's chart to back up his claim wages for production on supervisory workers those workers make up about 80 percent of the private labor force that mostly excludes the people at the top that's good it excludes the rich and super rich who might distort the average and make it less representative so this looks like a pretty good snapshot of the average worker to correct for inflation the chart uses the CPI aiyoo a price index calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that measures the price is paid by urban consumers and that's pretty depressing after taking account of the effects of inflation the average worker salary by 6 percent less stuff than in 1973 the economy's broken but what if we'd use the PCE to correct for inflation a price index often used by the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve the PC is calculated by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis it includes both urban and rural consumers and measures the price of health care and housing differently from the cpi-u it's also what's called a chained index it corrects for the fact that when some Goods get relatively more expensive you can substitute toward relatively cheaper goods because in real life you don't keep buying the same combination of goods in the same amount when prices change use the PC on the same date of the Krugman used and you get a very different picture the average worker standard of living is up 17% over the last 40 years that's not great but it's a lot better than worse off by 6 percent maybe the economy isn't totally broken after all but that's just one kind of data for a subset of the economy let's take a different look Jared Bernstein writing in The New York Times used data from the Congressional Budget Office on household income between 1979 and 2010 that corrects for inflation using the PCE he excludes the bottom 40 percent and the top 40 percent what's left is the middle fifth the middle quintile a pretty good snapshot of the middle class Bernstein takes the average earnings per household in that middle fifth in 2010 and compares it to average earnings per household in the middle fifth in 1979 for instance conclusion is very similar to Krugman's for middle-income households earnings have declined in real terms 7% from 1979 to 2010 the economy is broken 31 years of no progress for the middle class bernstein argues that the only things keeping the middle class financially healthy are increases in government spending and tax cuts Bernstein's numbers use of the PC 8 and he gets the same depressing result as Krugman is that the end of the story [Music] Bernstein and Krugman only looked at cash compensation that leaves out benefits because benefits have become more important since the 1970s leaving them out understates the true standard of living and how much it's grown CBO has a broader measure of compensation what they call labor income it includes employer contributions to health care and some other forms of compensation the picture improves growth of labor incomes just about zero over this time period but still negative for the middle quintile again economy's broken but wait it's complicated Scott Winship writing in Forbes of magazine notes that Bernstein's measurement of middle-class Progress includes elderly households households headed by someone 65 or older a disproportionate share of their income comes from retirement benefits or investments even if the economy is doing well you wouldn't expect the earnings of the elderly to grow very much and in the 31 years between 1979 and 2010 the percentage of households in the middle quintile headed by people over 65 almost doubled going from 15% to 26% so when you calculate the change in average earnings in the middle quintile over time you're including more and more people whose earnings are stagnant not because the economy's lousy because they're retired or working very little what we're measuring might be due to the changing composition of the middle class rather than the impact of the economy to see if this is important Winship looks at CBO data on middle quintile house who have children under the age of 18 now too many elderly households there and non elderly households without children and what does Winship find when you look at labor income and exclude most of the elderly pretty steady growth very different picture compared to Bernstein's or Krugman's so who's right what's the answer how has the middle class or the average American been doing over the last 30 or 40 years you tell me you want to get depressed about the state of the American economy and feel justified that we need to do something about it I've got just the picture for you you want to feel optimistic and think we should leave things alone I've got that too I'm reminded of the old joke where the client asks how much is two plus two and the consultant says how much do you want it to be but what's the right number where's the truth the truth that turns out is complicated for starters while a 23% improvement is a lot better than a 7% decrease 23% over three decades is pretty mediocre that's not stagnation but it's nothing to celebrate and there are a lot of things in the economy that need changing but having said that I'm also pretty sure that even the most cheerful numbers understate how the middle class has been doing since the 1970s to see why we have to dig a little deeper you [Music],"Economics, Data Analysis, Inflation, Wages, Finance",,,,,,,,"Economical, Science,

29,The Fallen of World War II,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKPFT-RioU,DwKPFT-RioU,"the average lifespan of an American is 80 years and an 80-year-old today was 10 when World War II ended four when it began a soldier who saw battle would have to be in his late 80s at least today generals political leaders the decision makers of the war few are still with us and over the past few decades we've seen authors and filmm makers rush to capture stories from survivors before this connection of memory is lost this project is not about individual War Stories and it's not about survivors we're going to tally up the tens of millions of people whose lives are cut short by the war and see how these numbers stack up to other Wars in history including Trends in recent conflicts [Music] we'll be counting soldiers and civilians separately each of these figures represents 1,000 people who died civilians were of all walks of life whereas military deaths were almost entirely men the average age was about 23 in most battles for every 1,000 soldiers killed there are more than a thousand who were injured the word casualty can be confusing because in military speak it often includes both deaths and injuries and anything else that takes a soldier out of service here we're just counting the deaths and we'll begin with American [Music] soldiers over 400,000 died most of the deaths occurred in the European theater fighting the Nazis and about a quarter were in the Pacific fighting the Japanese when you put them on the timeline you see that casualties were the heaviest at the end of the war The War Began on September 1st 1939 but the US wasn't willing to join the fight until Pearl Harbor 2 years in the deaths increased drastically on dday when the Allies invaded Normandy one of the most tragic moments of the war was on D-Day at Omaha Beach where 2500 Americans fell so about the same number of US soldiers died on this single Beach Landing as the entire 13 years of the recent war in Afghanistan the bloodiest battle in the Pacific was okanawa which lasted 82 days during which 12,500 Americans died about 5,000 of these deaths were at Sea from kamakazi [Music] attacks now let's look at some other countries starting with Europe Germany started World War II when it invaded Poland Poland ultimately lost 200,000 soldiers in the war most died after the invasion while the country was occupied by Germany in the Soviet Union Germany meanwhile lost just 16,000 in the invasion of Poland the Nazis went on to invade and Conquer other countries including Denmark Belgium the Netherlands France Greece and Yugoslavia France surrendered but after losing 92,000 soldiers in the Battle of France over 200,000 ultimately fell which includes deaths in P camps French colonies and other fights Yugoslavia suffered almost half a million military deaths the initial Invasion brought relatively few casualties on both sides but the deaths mounted under Nazi occupation due to Guerilla fighting civil conflict and mass executions the Nazi invasions were Swift with relatively few German losses even the Nazi commanders expressed surprise at their success and then we have the United Kingdom in the United States who are not invaded but took the fight to the Nazis Britain lost about the same number of soldiers as the US which includes the British colonies Germany lost about half a million soldiers fighting the US and Britain in what is known as the Western Front which took place in France and [Music] Belgium but most Nazi soldiers died in the Eastern Front Germany's unsuccessful invasion of the Soviet Union the numbers are staggering the most famous battle of the Eastern front and perhaps the turning point of the European war was Stalingrad the German 6th Army successfully took Stalingrad but then got surrounded by the Soviets and cut off from food and ammunition half a million Nazis would ultimately die in Stalingrad another 100,000 were taken prisoner of which 6,000 would ever return PWS had a low survival rate throughout World War III and it was particularly Grim in the East when you include these PS roughly the same number of Germans died in Stalingrad as all the Western Front fighting against France the UK and the US and though Stalingrad was a victory for the Soviets they suffered almost twice as many losses as [Music] Germany the Soviet Union would eventually defeat the once Unstoppable German Army killing 2.3 millon million Nazi soldiers but winning the war came at a costume [Music] [Music] 8.7 million is the official tally by the Russian military a hly disputed number some Studies have calculated as many as 14 million dead to complete the count of European military deaths we need to add German deaths from other fronts including the North in Africa as well as deaths from other Axis Powers Allied of the Nazis Hungary Romania and Italy when you put these European military debts on the timeline it looks like this you can now interact with the chart to learn more pause the narration if you would like more time and now we switch to civilian deaths in [Music] Europe 6 million Jewish people were killed in the Holocaust if you separate this by country you see that about half 2.7 million were polish 700,000 were Soviets followed by Hungary and 17 other countries [Music] r broken down another way about half of the 6 million were killed in the concentration camps over a million died in osht most were killed in the gas Chambers others died from starvation exhaustion disease and other forms of [Music] execution the second most deadly Camp was Tri blinka which was exclusively an extermination camp set up to look like a train station mobile killing groups killed 1.4 million [Music] Jews like with the gas Chambers men were killed first to reduce the risk of revolt [Music] the Holocaust also includes non-jewish deaths between 130,000 to 500,000 Roma then called gypsies were killed the numbers are disputed about a quar million people with disabilities were killed homosexuals Catholics and other groups were also exterminated but their numbers were relatively small some historians say that other civilian deaths should go under the label of Holocaust about 2 million non-jewish poles were killed under German occupation some of which were sent to the gas Chambers at owitz when you combine civilian and Military deaths over 16% of the total polish population died in World War II which is the highest percentage of any country but not the highest in total death count the Soviet Union again tops that list losing at least as many civilians as it did soldiers somewhere between 10 and 20 million a particularly dark moment for the Soviet Union was the sieg of Leningrad now St Petersburg German forces surrounded Leningrad before civilians could be evacuated supplies including food were cut off for 2 and 1/2 years 1 and 1/2 million people died as a result mostly from starvation mostly civilians Stalin's cruelty towards his own people is partly responsible for these numbers he often didn't allow civilians to evacuate from cities thinking it would cause the soldiers protecting them to fight harder about a million Soviets died in Stalin's own labor camps called the gulock just about every country suffered civilian losses especially countries who were invaded while many died as a result of so-called collateral damage the biggest numbers occurred when it was no accident civilians were exterminated purposely fired upon or bombed used as human Shields or intentionally deprived of food the intentional killing of civilians was done by most Waring parties including the United Kingdom and the United States the United Kingdom was spared of a land Invasion but still lost 60,000 civilians largely from German Air Raids or blitzes often directed at civilian population centers the UK did the same to German cities at a much greater magnitude causing about 10 times the number of deaths but most German civilian deaths came from the ground at the late stage of the war when the Nazi regime collapsed civilians living in occupied regions had to desperately flee from the advancing Soviet Army rapes were widespread and death estimates ranged from 600,000 to 3 [Music] million let's step back and see where we are with the totals we just counted about 20 million civilian deaths in Europe if you add this to the European military deaths we already covered it brings us to over 40 million then we have the Asian theater here we see the vast majority of military debts in Asia came from China and Japan on the civilian side about 6 million deaths from China Indonesia Korea Indochina and the Philippines can be attributed to Japanese war crimes which are sometimes compared to the Nazi atrocities due to the sheer scale of the cruelty China had the second highest death count after the Soviet Union and like the Soviets the Chinese government demonstrated a stunning willingness to sacrifice its own people Chinese nationalists open the Dyke at the Yellow River hoping the flood would halt the Japanese Advance half a million Chinese civilians or more were killed which is two or three times the number who died in all countries in the 2004 Asian tsunamis but the invasion of China only cost Japan 200,000 soldiers most were killed fighting the US and allies in the Pacific [Music] War significant portion of Japanese civilian deaths were caused by American firebombing and the two nuclear attacks contrary to official US statements these air strikes were directed at civilian populations not military targets when you add all the deaths outside Europe it brings us to a grand total of 70 million for the war give or take depending on who's counting and what civilian deaths get included more people died in World War II than in any other war in history for comparison here are 20 or so of the very worst wars and atrocities we have on record some of these are more of atrocities than Wars but we've seen how that distinction can get blurry some of these spanned across centuries World War II had the highest body count and it all happened in just 6 years the world's population has grown significantly since the earliest atrocities on this list if you want to compare them in terms of what percentage of the world died we can adjust the chart to look like this this rough approximation tells us there may have been more devastating Wars before World War II proportionally [Music] speaking when we turn to post-war conflicts it's hard to say anything that isn't controversial but the data shows something quite extraordinary has been happening in 1989 John Gattis coined the phrase the long piece to identify the absence of conflict between the nuclear powers during the Cold War 25 years later the Cold War is Over and the term is still being used although its meaning may have shifted European countries have not fought each other except for this 10-day war in 1956 when the Soviet Union invaded Hungary when we look at European Wars before World War II it looks like this they tend to be more frequent as they go back though smaller in scale and the largest 44 economies of the world have not battled each other since World War II rich countries have fought poor countries like the US versus Iraq but rich countries have not fought other rich countries such a period of peace between the so-called great Powers hasn't been seen since the Roman Empire to many peace is too strong of a word Wars have occurred since World War II and they can be grouped into these four categories we don't see colonial wars anymore we've already noted that Interstate Wars between rich countries have not occurred at all and here we see wars involving smaller economies have tapered off that leaves Civil Wars of two types with and without foreign intervention and this is what these battle deaths look like alongside of World War II more people died fighting in World War II than in all the wars since and again we can't forget about world population which has almost tripled since World War II if we scale these numbers to show deaths in proportion to world population showing the likelihood that a person on Earth dies in battle the downward Trend becomes even more pronounced now this isn't to infer anything about why this trend is occurring that's a discussion for another day you can now interact with this chart to explore what conflicts are behind the totals now bear in mind we're just just looking at Battle deaths here not civilian deaths but those two are in Decline peace is a difficult thing to measure it's a bit like counting the people who didn't die in wars that never happened we give such importance to the word piece but we don't tend to notice it when it occurs or report on it sometimes it takes reminding ourselves of how terrible War once was to see the peace that has been growing around us of course this trend may not continue and it's not clear how looking at these charts can help us make the right decisions to ensure that it does but the longer the long piece grows the more significant it becomes so if watching the news doesn't make us feel hopeful about where things are heading watching the numbers might [Music] if You' like to support this project and encourage new episodes please follow us using one of the options below and

30,Costs of War: the Human Toll of the Post-9/11 Wars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVr0MSEW2SU,aVr0MSEW2SU,"The prolonged US wars
in Iraq and Afghanistan have been widely covered
through the years but their consequences--
including the related violence in Syria and Pakistan--
remain poorly understood. When Americans are asked
about the human toll of these conflicts, they often
think first of US soldiers who have lost their lives
or who are struggling with war injuries and trauma. But the true number
of casualties is much, much greater. [MUSIC PLAYING] By 2016, nearly
6,900 US soldiers have lost their lives
in the war zones. Roughly half of these deaths
were caused by hostile fire and improvised
explosive devices, along with vehicle crashes,
electrocutions, and heat stroke deaths. In addition to US soldiers,
many US contractors have died in action, as well. The contracting
companies, however, have failed to report
many of these deaths. A conservative estimate is that
at least 7,000 of these workers have been killed in both wars. In addition, for every
US soldier killed, six Afghan, Pakistani, and
Iraqi security personnel have died, as well. In other words, more
than 50,000 allied Afghan, Pakistani, and
Iraqi soldiers and police have died in combat. The figures available
for opposition fighters are controversial, because
allied forces have often been motivated to count
killed civilians as militants. One estimate, however,
puts the total number of fighters killed in
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq at 110,000. The largest number
in the death toll, however, is not
soldiers, but civilians. Living in these war
zones, civilians have been killed in their homes,
in markets, and on roadways. They have been killed by
US warplanes and soldiers, by the US allies, and by
insurgents and sectarians in the civil wars
spawned by the invasions. The total of violent civilian
deaths in the Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq
wars are conservatively counted at 217,000. Every single one of these
deaths devastates a family and debilitates a community. This total of over 390,000
dead soldiers and civilians, however, includes
only those who have been counted as direct deaths,
or deaths by bomb or bullet. An additional large number of
people have died in these wars by indirect means,
as they have in all the wars of human history. They have died due to
hunger, disease, or injury that resulted from
the wars' disruptions and environmental harm. It is difficult to estimate
just how many people have died indirectly in these
wars, but researchers suggest that in
recent conflicts, for every one
direct death, there are at least four
other indirect deaths. A conservative estimate
is that these wars may have resulted in
the indirect deaths of an additional
870,000 civilians. Unfortunately, these
numbers are still estimates, with no party to the conflict
taking responsibility for a full accounting of the
direct or indirect death toll. [MUSIC PLAYING]","War, Casualties, Conflicts, Middle-East, History",,,,,,,,"Military, Social, History, Geography"
31,The Formula For Economic Growth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4G4AiuWOSk&list=WL&index=30,R4G4AiuWOSk,[Music] economic growth has been slow for the last decade to understand why it helps to consider the factors that cause growth rates to change economic growth comes from optics and productivity and increases and the total number of hours works in the economy when more people work more productively the economy grows productivity increases when workers produce more than they did before this occurs either because workers obtain higher levels of education or because companies invest in physical capital like tools factories and equipment that enable employees to increase their output recently though productivity has grown at only a quarter of its historical pace largely due to reduced investment economic growth has lagged as a result and the percentage of people working today is much lower than previously expected even after taking into account the baby boomers retiring there are millions of able-bodied adults who are no longer participating in the workforce getting back to our historical level of growth is possible but it will require policies that encourage people to rejoin the workforce and policies that spur more investment in education and the tools that help make workers more productive,"Economics, Productivity, Employment, Growth, Education",,,,,,,,"Economical, Social"
32,Why measles is back in the US,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2swde6Z97w,Z2swde6Z97w,"This is a chart of reported measles cases
in the US. In the 1950s, measles was one of those diseases
that nearly every child got. It caused a high fever and a spotty rash all
over the body. And while most recovered easily, it still
killed around 500 children each year. Then in 1963, a vaccine became available. And measles became an easily preventable and
unnecessary disease. By 2000, measles was officially eliminated
in the US. And for a time, less than a hundred Americans
a year got it. But In the last decade, that number has started
to grow. Now, there have been more cases through the
first three months of 2019 than all of 2018. Measles is back. And to understand why, you have to understand
where it’s back. Measles can be quite serious, but now no one
needs to get them. Here are those recent measles cases again. If we look at the 2013 spike, we notice
something. A good chunk of those cases can be attributed
to an outbreak among Orthodox Jews in New York. That huge spike in 2014? Most of those cases are all from one outbreak
among the Amish in Ohio. 2017? One outbreak in the Somali-American community
in Minnesota,. 2018? Different communities of New York Orthodox
Jews. And again in 2019. What all of this shows is that the return
of measles isn’t as widespread as you might think. 75% of recent cases have happened in these
close-knit communities. People in these communities tend to read the
same news, watch the same TV programs, speak the same language. Julia Belluz, Vox health reporter. They go to school together, they worship together. When not enough of them are vaccinated - you
know, it tends to spread like wildfire. Like in early 2019 outside Vancouver, Washington
where a measles outbreak sickened 73 people. It originated at a local Slavic church, likely
from someone who picked up the disease in Eastern Europe. It quickly spread through the community, infecting
mostly small children who weren’t immunized. One reason this happened is that the Slavic
community in Washington has one of the lowest rates of vaccination in the state. Some of the people in this community don’t
trust doctors. Yuriy is a member of that community. He’s also a health data analyst. They have a view that big pharma is too ingrained
with the medical establishment. They are much more willing to listen to members
of the community. Anti-vaccination misinformation can reach
anyone - but it’s in these small communities where it does the most damage. Most people in these communities are vaccinated. The problem starts when not enough people
are vaccinated - it prevents them from reaching what’s called herd immunity. Here’s how it works. With every vaccine you need a certain perc
entage of the community to be immunized in order for the vaccine to work. If a group of people comes into contact with
one person contagious with measles - and none of them are vaccinated - virtually everyone
will get sick. If 50% of the group is vaccinated, that’s
not enough - the rest are likely to get sick and spread the disease. But at a certain point, if enough people are
vaccinated, - they can actually protect the few that aren’t vaccinated from getting
sick, stopping the spread of the disease — herd immunity. This is important because there are people
who can’t get vaccinated because of their immune system: people like cancer patients
and newborn babies. And with measles because it’s so contagious,
that number is just really really high - it's 95% So basically everyone who can get vaccinated
needs to be vaccinated. We’re protecting all those people who can’t
get vaccines. That 95% number doesn't leave much wiggle
room, and a lot of US states are now struggling to meet it. These are the states where the number of kindergarteners vaccinated for measles is below the herd immunity threshold. It's half of states. So how do we make sure everyone who can get
vaccinated does? It might help it look at it this way. These are the states that allow parents to
opt-out for religious reasons. And these are the states that allow parents
to opt out for any philosophical reason. And then, there are a few states that allow
neither. The two states that have had no exemptions
for a very long time - Mississippi and West Virginia - they haven’t seen outbreaks in
recent years. Part of why Washington’s Slavic community
has such low vaccination rates is simply because Washington allows them to easily opt-out. In parts of the state, including where the
outbreak occurred, the amount of vaccinated kindergarteners has fallen way below the amount
needed for herd immunity. But since the outbreak, Legislators in Washington
have introduced a bill to get rid of non-medical vaccine exemptions. Maybe the best way to make sure all communities
reach herd immunity, and protect those that can’t be vaccinated, is just to not let
them opt out in the first place. In this video you may have noticed we used Woccas. And it's designs like these that are constantly testing my Illustrator skills.

33,Corruption is Legal in America,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig,5tu32CCA_Ig,for the last few years I've had this sense that everything I learned as a kid about how America's government works is completely wrong but I had no idea how bad things actually were until I saw this one graph researchers at Princeton University looked at more than 20 years worth of data to answer a pretty simple question does the government represent the people now this is what they found this access here represents public support for any given idea on the left at 0% are ideas that not a single American want on the right at 100% are ideas that everyone supports this axis represents the likelihood of Congress passing a law that reflects any of these ideas from a zero to a 100% chance on this graph an ideal Republic would look like this if 50% of the public supports an idea there's a 50% chance of it becoming law if 80% of us support something there's an 80% chance you get the idea now most Americans would probably agree that with a few exceptions we should be as close to this ideal as possible unfortunately the way America actually works doesn't even come close take an idea that nobody supports literally nobody and it has about a 30% chance of becoming federal law now take an incredibly popular idea the most popular idea this country has ever seen and there's also about a 30% chance of it becoming law this means that the number of American voters for or against any idea has has no impact on the likelihood that Congress will make it law put another way and I'm just going to quote the Princeton study directly here the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule near zero statistically non-significant impact upon public policy so if you've ever felt like your opinion doesn't matter and that the government doesn't really care what you think well you're right but there's a catch this flat line only accounts for the bottom 90 % of income earners in America economic Elites business interests people who can afford lobbyists they get their own line look at how much closer their line is to the ideal when they want something the government is much more likely to do it and when they don't they have the power to completely block it from happening no matter how much the rest of the country supports it they get what they want and guess who ends up paying for it we pay for it with the most expensive he care in the world we pay for it with a tax code that's a complete mess we pay for it with internet that's slower and more expensive with wasteful spending a floundering education system a catastrophic drug war and one in five American children born into poverty almost every major issue we face as a nation can be traced back to this graph how does this happen well just follow the money right now it's perfectly legal to buy political influence uence in America here's how it works let's say a big Bank wants a law that would force taxpayers to bail them out again if they repeat the exact same Reckless Behavior that crashed the global economy in 2008 not exactly the most popular idea with the public and Congress knows that that should be the end of it but that's where the money comes in it's perfectly legal for our bank to hire a team of lobbyists whose entire job is to make sure that the government gives the bank What It Wants then those lobbyists can track down members of Congress who regulate Banks and help raise a ton of money for their re-election campaigns it's perfectly legal for those lobbyists to offer those same politicians million jobs at their lobbying firm then those lobbyists can literally write the language of this new bailout law themselves and hand it off to the politician they just buttered up with campaign money and lucrative job offers and it's perfectly legal for those politicians to take the lobbyist written language and sneak it through Congress at the last second so now you've got a law that greatly benefits the bank and the whole process can start over this is how a bill becomes a law a special interest hires some lobbyists those lobbyists collect campaign contributions offer jobs and then write the laws that congress then passes to help those same special interests this happens every day on every single issue with politicians of both parties in The Last 5 Years alone the 200 most politically active companies in the United States spent $5.8 billion influencing your government those same companies got 4.4 trillion in taxpayer support and that's trillion with a t and that's just the top 200 companies never mind every other special interest every Union every trade Association and every billionaire every single one of them can use their money to buy political influence you know there's this idea out there that this only became a problem after the Supreme Court citizens united decision in 2010 but the data goes back almost 40 years and the results are clear corruption is legal in America and as long as it is anyone who can spend money to buy political influence will the solution here isn't rocket science make corruption illegal we already know Congress won't do it I mean one look at this chart will tell you that what we need is a plan that lets us go around Congress and do what the American people do best fix this mess ourselves well good news we have that plan and it's already already working now that we've got the problem covered let us show you how to be part of the [Music] solution,"Politics, Corruption, Legislation, Democracy,

We budget a lot of money, have a lot of people who think about nuclear deterrence, I'm very glad that works being done and I rate the chance of a nuclear war in my
lifetime has being fairly low. I rate the chance of a widespread
epidemic far worse than Ebola in my lifetime as well over 50 percent. If we look at the 20th Century, and we look at the death chart of the 20th Century, I think everybody
would say oh yeah there must be a spike from World War I and you know sure enough there it is like
25 million and I must be a big spike for World War II,
and there it is – like 65 million but then you'll see this other spike
that is as large as World War II, right
after World War I – and most people, a lot of people say what?  Wait a minute – what was that? There's two kinds of flus: There's flus that spread between humans very effectively and there's flus that kill lots of
people. And those two properties have only been combined I into a widespread flu once in history.  That is Spanish Flu. We have no idea where it
came from  – it's called the Spanish flu because the Spanish press was the freest, they were the first to talk openly about it. and so in the annals of epidemic
history that's the big event. I funded a disease modeling group that
uses computer simulation and that work has been phenomenal in
helping us target our polio eradication resources
– which parts of nigeria should we work harder on? And it's very natural if
you have a group like that to say hey look at something like the Spanish flu
in the modern day. Health systems are far better and so you'd think, hey that wouldn't be very bad. Well, we tried it –  and there are some assumptions we had to make – but what we showed is that the force of infection, because modern
transport which be compared to 1918 is over fifty
times as great, if you get something like the [Spanish] flu
and you look at that map of how within days it's basically in all urban centers of the entire globe That is very, uh, eye-opening. that didn't happen with Spanish flu in
the past. The opportunity in did do more than just let it run its course is really only in
the last decade basically when you talk about drugs, you can talk about small molecules or you can talk about these complex biological protein like things
which is a subclass called antibodies antibodies are the molecules the immune
system naturally builds to attack disease Today, the idea that somebody says oh
here's an antibody make a lot of it made it very quickly
that's right on the cutting edge. and the Ebola epidemic showed me that
we're not ready for a serious epidemic. An epidemic that
would be more infectious and would spread faster than Ebola did. This is the greatest
risk have a huge tragedy. This is the most
likely thing by far to kill over 10 million excess people in a year. We don't need to invest nearly
what we do in military preparedness. this is
something where less than a billion a year on R&D,
medical surveillance, on standby personnel, cross-training the
military so they can play a role in terms of all the logistics here. This can
be done and we may not get many more warnings
like this one to to say okay it's a pretty modest
investment to avoid something that, really, in terms
of the human condition would be a gigantic setback.","Disasters, Health, Epidemic, Science, History",,,,,,,,"Health, History, Science"

39,How Republican and Democratic voters have changed since 1992,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UMnQq_LRQs,9UMnQq_LRQs,"- [Narrator] Over the past 25 years, American voters have grown
more racially diverse, better educated, less religious, and older. These shifts have reshaped
both the Republican and Democratic parties, but it different ways. Non-whites are increasing as a share of all registered voters, and this increase has been more dramatic among Democrats than Republicans. The non-white share of Democratic voters has increased 18 percentage
points since 1992, while the non-white share of GOP voters is up just six points. Americans are better educated
today than in the past, and levels of education are rising fastest within the Democratic Party. The share of Democratic
voters with a college degree is up 16 points since 1992. Meanwhile, the share of Republican voters who are college graduates
has risen three points. The fastest growing
religious group in the US does not identify with a religion at all. It is those who are
religiously unaffiliated, calling themselves atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular. While the share of Republican voters who are unaffiliated
has increased six points since 1996, the share of Democratic
voters who are unaffiliated is up 19 points. The US has grown older in recent decades, but this is especially
true of Republican voters, who are now significantly
older than Democrats. Since 1992, the share of GOP voters ages 50 and older has risen 20 points, compared with the rise of
six points for this age group among Democratic voters. On most measures, the demographic changes transforming the nation have had a more pronounced
impact among Democrats than Republicans. The result is two political parties whose voters look less alike today than they did 25 years ago. (gentle music) (keyboard clattering) (gentle chiming music)","Politics, Demographics, Education, Religion, Age",,,,,,,,"Political, Social"

41,There Is No Gender Wage Gap,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcDrE5YvqTs,QcDrE5YvqTs,"If, for the same work, women make only 77
cents for every dollar a man makes, why don’t businesses hire only women? Wages are the biggest expense for most businesses. So, hiring only women would reduce costs by
nearly a quarter – and that would go right to the bottom line. Don’t businesses want to be profitable? Or, are they just really bad at math? Well, actually, it’s the feminists, celebrities
and politicians spreading this wage gap myth who have the math problem. Here’s why: The 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic is calculated
by dividing the median earnings of all women working full-time by the median earnings of
all men working full-time. In other words, if the average income of all
men is, say, 40,000 dollars a year, and the average annual income of all women is, say,
30,800 dollars, that would mean that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. 30,800 divided by 40,000 equals .77. But these calculations don’t reveal a gender
wage injustice because it doesn’t take into account occupation, position, education or
hours worked per week. Even a study by the American Association of
University Women, a feminist organization, shows that the actual wage gap shrinks to
only 6.6 cents when you factor in different choices men and women make. And the key word here is “choice.” The small wage gap that does exist has nothing
to do with paying women less, let alone with sexism; it has to do with differences in individual
career choices that men and women make. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released
a paper that examined more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and concluded that the oft-cited 23
percent wage gap “may be almost entirely the result of individual choices being made
by both male and female workers.” Well, let’s look at some of those choices. Georgetown University compiled a list of the
five best-paying college majors, and the percentage of men or women majoring in those fields: Number 1 best-paying major: Petroleum Engineering:
87% male Number 2: Pharmaceutical Sciences: 48% male
3: Mathematics and Computer Science: 67% male 4: Aerospace Engineering: 88% male
5: Chemical Engineering: 72% male Notice that women out-represent men in only
one of the five top-paying majors – by only a few percentage points. Now consider the same study’s list of the
five worst paying college majors: Number 1: Counseling and Psychology: 74% female
Number 2: Early Childhood Education: 97% female 3: Theology and Religious Vocations: 66% male
4: Human Services and Community Organization: 81% female
5: Social Work: 88% female Here, it’s the women who lead in all but
one category. Even within the same profession, men and women
make different career choices that impact how much money they make. Take nursing, where male nurses on the whole
earn 18% more than female nurses. The reason? Male nurses gravitate to the best-paying nursing
specialties, they work longer hours, and disproportionately find jobs in cities with the highest compensation. Now, here’s how one expert on nursing compensation,
Professor Linda Aiken of the University of Pennsylvania, sums up the data: “Career
choices and educational differences explain most, if not all, the gender gap in nursing.” The Department of Labor paper concluded that
once these differences are accounted for across all professions, the unexplained wage gap
is somewhere between 4.8 and 7 percent – almost identical to the 6.6 percentage gap found
by the AAUW. But why is there any gap at all? No one knows for sure, as both the AAUW and
the Labor Department concede. There are so many variables that drive wages
that no single study can cover them all. Few wage gap studies control for variables
such as dangerous work environment; men are vastly overrepresented, for example, on oil
rigs. And here’s another variable: men are more
willing and able to work long hours without advance notice. According to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin,
even if two lawyers have the same education, same specialty, and work the same number
of hours — firms pay more to someone who is willing to always be “on call” and ready
to be in the office when the firm needs them, as opposed to wanting a more regular schedule. This isn’t sexism, it’s just common sense. With more realistic categories and definitions,
whatever wage gap remains would certainly narrow to point of vanishing. So it seems that business leaders aren’t
bad at math simply because they don’t only hire women. Those who claim that for the same work women
earn 77 cents on the dollar compared to men, on the other hand, are not merely bad at math
--but at telling the truth. I’m Christina Hoff Sommers of the American
Enterprise Institute for Prager University.","Gender, Equality, Business, Economics, Education",,,,,,,,"Social, Economical"

Regional Covid data story,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F70PS2OcPWE,F70PS2OcPWE,i was born in and raised in the midwest and what i've been seeing in the daily data lately is something that's that's personally concerning to me and i feel like it hasn't been fully covered and i'd like to really show that in the data so you can make your own informed decisions um so what we're looking at is that we're looking at the seven day moving average for the total number of new cases for that region and so what we're looking at is that we broke this out by state and when we do that we can sort of take a walk through time and so if we look back at what was going on in april and may towards the start it was really new york new jersey sort of the northeast that was driving that first wave of activity and then we started to go down and then we saw that second sort of peak and that was really driven by the south and the west and what we're seeing recently is that every region is increasing but a particular note is the midwest which is seeing its localized maximum at this point and the thing to account for is that this is total so this is not per capita taking into account the population of these regions where the south has actually way more people and so if we adjust this per capita what we start to see is that actually the midwest on a per capita level is equivalent to and still rising compared to all these other peaks that we saw before and so i'd like to drill into the midwest a little further here so if we isolate the midwest and we look at that per capita basis each state of the midwest where are these numbers you know what we see is that these totals that we're listing here so five percent in north dakota etc is the total of the area underneath the curve because we're looking at the seven day moving average of new cases and this is the total percentage per capita that is infected or has previously been infected with covid19 and tested positive so you know this i think helps paint perhaps a different picture and one that i think should be alarming and should you know hopefully cause some some actions to be taken um because even if we look at this you know compared to new york and new jersey and the the northeast you know we can see that these peaks that we saw back in april and may are actually less than what we're seeing currently in north dakota south dakota wisconsin and that's something that we should really keep in mind it's not the total number it's the percentage that per capita that matters you know we can even see rhode island is starting to increase as well um and so if we take all of this into account you know i'm going to zoom back out here and we're going to actually look at all 50 states you know we're seeing this increase every state is starting to increase again and that's really something not every state but most states are starting to increase here on that per capita level it's something we really need to to try to take action on um and so let me just jump to this last step just to help further illustrate this and look at this actually mapped so what does this look like on a map itself and hopefully this helps paint a little bit of a picture that's that might be easier to visualize where we can see those same colors that are mapped per region and we can see the total percentage of the population that has tested positive for covid19 so you know 2.3 percent here in california all the way up to that five percent that we saw in north dakota et cetera and so as we go through you can you know get a sense for for what's going on in this country and hopefully this data story you know helps to illustrate you know the current state and to form your own opinions and make better data-driven decisions about what health mitigation strategies we're adopting hopefully that's helpful and thanks so much,"Health, Statistics, Analysis, Pandemic, Midwest",,,,,,,,"Health, Geography"
43,What happens when women win elections,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYyacj_tYs4,rYyacj_tYs4,"The 2018 midterms were huge for women candidates. In Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn became the
state's first woman senator. Over in Massachusetts, Ayanna Pressley is
the first African-American woman elected to the House from any state in New England. In Maine, voters chose Janet Mills to be the
state’s first woman governor. Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland became the
first Native American women elected to Congress. A total of 273 women were on the ballot in
the 2018 midterms, representing both parties. Now compare that to the past five elections
— that’s a big jump in women candidates vying for office. So, women must be pretty well represented
in the US government now, right? Not exactly. The share of women in the House and Senate
has increased over time....but it’s still well below the share of women in the US population. If you dig deeper, Congress looks even less
representative. Women of color make up 18% of the US population. But, before the 2018 midterms they accounted
for just 7% of Congress. And LGBT women make up 2.5% of the US population,
but there are only two openly LGBT women in Congress -- that's less than 1% Even with the recent wins by women candidates
in the 2018 midterms, there’s still a long way to go before they’re fully represented. This underrepresentation can have very real
policy consequences. Take a look at this chart showing what 2018
congressional candidates spent time talking about. Women were much more likely than men to discuss
issues — like education, climate change, and minimum wage. There’s even evidence that women make better
lawmakers. One study found that female lawmakers bring
in 9% more federal spending for their constituents than their male counterparts. And that’s on top of the fact that women
lawmakers sponsor more bills than male legislators. This success might actually help explain why
women are less likely to run for office than men in the first place. Many women underestimate their qualifications
and perceive gender bias among voters, which discourages them from running. Because of these extra hurdles, only the most
talented and ambitious women seek office. While there’s still more room for growth
for women to be accurately represented in government, there’s evidence to show that
the more women are elected, the more they inspire other women to run. One study found that if a state elected a
woman senator or governor, an average of seven additional women would run for the state government
in the following election cycle. The women that were elected during the 2018
midterms will help inspire other women to run for office in the future. And as more women join government, their representation
will become more and more normalized. And eventually — a video like this won’t
even be necessary.","Politics, Women, Representation, Elections, Government",,,,,,,,"Political, Social"

47,The racist history of US immigration policy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yiQAmgI5s4,6yiQAmgI5s4,"So, the issue of who to let into this country and who to not let into this country is about as old as the country itself. It’s an issue that America’s 
debated since the early 19th century and we’ve admitted people 
from nearly every single country since. But it hasn’t really been an even admission process. So, this line represents 200,000 
legal immigrants to the US and we’re going to stack them up to see when they came to the US and where they came from. So early on, most were European, 
largely Irish, German, and British. And there were also, Chinese and Canadian immigrants. But in 1882, the US passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese immigration for 10 years. That was extended and then made permanent —and it wasn’t repealed for 61 years. The economic depression of the 1890s 
decreased European immigration and nearly stopped Canadian immigration entirely. But after the depression, the 
demographics of immigrants changed. And there was a rise in Russian, Italians, 
Spanish, and Japanese immigrants. In 1917, the US banned immigration from 
Asian countries entirely— except from the Philippines and Japan. In 1921, the US capped 
immigration based on nationality. This severely limited the ability to immigrate to the US for people not from the western hemisphere or a country with older roots in the US. Then, the Great Depression happened. All immigration plummeted. Then, World War II happened. The US refused to increase immigration caps for 20,000 Jewish children fleeing Nazi rule. It also stopped naturalization proceedings 
for Italians, Germans, and Japanese. In 1952, the US stopped excluding 
immigrants based on race. But more stringent quotas meant most 
slots were for Western Europeans. In 1965, the quota system was entirely repealed. It allowed for a far more diverse group of immigrants, particularly from Central America and South America, but also Asia. In the 1970s and 80s, Asian immigrants 
arrived in huge numbers, largely from the Philippines, 
South Korea, India, and Hong Kong. The US also evacuated a 130,000 people 
from Vietnam after the war. In the 1990s, the US increased
immigration caps to 700,000 annually. The country began to invest in border security to discourage unauthorized immigration, but in exchange allowed nearly 
1.7 million Mexican immigrants in the 1990s. Immigration to the US is now more diverse than ever, but with the rise of ISIS and the Syrian refugee crisis, prominent politicians are again talking about 
which immigrant groups to restrict. If you want to see how people from a specific country came to the US, click here for the full interactive.","Immigration, History, Legislation, Diversity, Nationality",,,,,,,,"Social, History, Political"
48,All the Medalists: Men’s Long Jump,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3LzKoMKjjk,a3LzKoMKjjk,Greg Rutherford of Britain won Gold with a long jump of 27t 3 and a/4 in let's compare that to all the medal winning jumps since 1896 there are more than 80 athletes here spending a century of Olympic history what do we see here definitely a lot of Americans own almost all the golds more than half of all medals most of these athletes jump more than 25 ft but how far is that a better sense of scale might help let's start with something we might know a little better say an NBA basketball court even 100 years ago athletes could jump way past the free throw line and most would be past the top of the key but there's one clear standout here past the NBA three-point line is the jump that belongs to Bob Beeman one of the most iconic Olympians ever in Mexico City in 1968 he jumped 29 ft 2 1/2 in more than 2 feet farther than anyone before an olympic record that's held for 44 years even the winner in Beijing Just 4 years ago is almost 2 feet back that's one reason the long jump is different unlike say swimming records aren't dropping year after year instead a few performances stand out after a flurry of improvement in the early games Jesse Owen set a record in Berlin that would have won a gold medal in any Olympics until 1960 ow was almost 23 when he made his jump so is youth the secret not exactly Carl Lewis won his first long jump in Los Angeles when he was 23 then repeated four years later in Soul then again in Barcelona and four years after that in Atlanta when he was 35 so what do Lewis and Owens have in common they both had gold medal speed and ultimately the long jump is a speed event but there are some things that jumpers can't control like wind some medalists have jumped into a headwind While others have had a Tailwind for Bean's event officials measured a 4 and2 mph Tailwind for all three medalists the maximum Tailwind allowed but wind alone doesn't account for 2 feet and jumping that far isn't impossible in 1991 outside the Olympics Mike Powell jumped about 2 in farther than Bean setting a world record that endures today but on the Olympic field Bean's record still stands 44 years later still better than any Olympian ever,"Sports, Olympics, History, Athletics, Records",,,,,,,,"Sports, History"
49,"The most important chart of 2014, explained in under a minute",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGoWEdGl82M,SGoWEdGl82M,"Here's a chart that shows something a little
bit shocking. Who actually reaps the financial gains when
the American economy grows. It ignores recessions and just looks at periods
of economic expansion. And it shows that for decades, the majority
of the gains went to the bottom 90% of the population. And that's what you'd expect, since that's
where most of the people are. But since 1980, the top 10% has gotten the
most of the gains, and in the most recent recovery, incomes for the majority of households
have actually fallen. That's why so many people say it feels like
the United States is in recession, even though it technically isn't in one. I don't think anyone really knows exactly
why this is happening, but it's clearly the biggest problem we've got, and it's a clear
sign the economy is broken.","Economics, Inequality, Society, Income, Recession",,,,,,,,"Economical, Social"
50,Bar chart race: the most populous cities through time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMs5xapBewM,pMs5xapBewM,you're looking at a bar chart race showing which cities had the largest populations at any time over history we're going to start the race at 1500 AD in the early 1500s most people lived in the East either the east of Europe and North Africa or the east of the world itself in India and China two countries that will be a regular occurring feature as we go on as that century went on Beijing went from being the largest city in the world to being encroached upon by Istanbul which then took the lead around 1600 India and China again are dominating here but note how Paris London and maples joined the ranks as other major European cities as the 1600s continued note Tokyo rising up there into second place at this stage Western Europe India and China are dominant but things are about to change in the later 1700s the Industrial Revolution took hold London who is already among the top three cities in the world but just wait to see what happens next keep an eye on that horizontal access over the next few seconds London here is still under a million people but as the 18th century turned into the 19th it's shot forward over a million look at that axis stretching out as London soars up hitting two million before 1850 and then racing on towards three all other cities pretty much left in the dust now another thing to watch now is the North American cities come along that continent was barely populated at the start of our time period as we move into the 20th century we have three North American cities and almost all the rest of European but watch for our old friend Tokyo shooting up through the rankings again after the Second World War took his population is around 10 million but look at that now it's doubled to 20 million within only about another 20 years and then soon hits 30 the thing to note in the last 30 years of the period is those European cities and North American cities falling out of the ranks and it's the emerging markets dominating with Asia India and Latin America the eagle-eyed among you may have noted one City vanish dropping from second or third in the top ten right out of the series altogether that was in 1565 when the Indian city of Vijayanagara was conquered in a military conquest and then procedurally burned to the ground over a period of months pretty much nothing was left and today only ruins survived I'm John burn Murdock and I make data visualizations at the Financial Times this chart was made using JavaScript using the coding platform observable all the data I used to make the chart and the code to create your own can be found at the link on screen let me know on Twitter if you have any comments or questions about this video itself or if you've made anything similar using the data [Music],"History, Population, Cities, Visualization, Data",,,,,,,,"History, Geography"
51,Donald Trump's $20 Trillion Problem,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgpfswDHA_Y,tgpfswDHA_Y,[Applause] the President of the United States faces a country divided on many of the big issues immigration foreign policies the economy these are just some of the obstacles that the Trump administration will have to tackle for many however there is one looming issue that has risen above all others an important how will vow from peel with the colossal 20 trillion dollar debt racked up by the federal government when the government doesn't have enough money to meet its obligations it borrows cash to pay the bills this running total is the national debt and it has been accumulating for decades in earlier days debt was increased by modest amounts but more recently the debt has increased by at least one trillion dollars during each of the last five presidencies this includes nearly 10 trillion dollars added between 2009 to 2017 during the Obama administration the total debt today over 20 trillion dollars the highest it's ever been and it's burdensome by pretty much any metric using debt to GDP the US has the eighth highest debt of advanced economies at a hundred and four percent on a per person basis each person in the u.s. Oh sixty one thousand three hundred dollars the second highest in the world per taxpayer however that amount balloons to 167 thousand dollars but by using debt to revenue a ratio comparing debt size to federal tax dollars the u.s. ranks number two in the world at an extraordinary 979 percent second only to Japan so what is Trump think of all this debt business at the start of his campaign he said that debt would be a top priority for his administration according to trump the u.s. was becoming a large scale version of Greece and that tackling the debt would be easy with a more dynamic economy he even claimed that he could pay off the debt after eight years in office this rhetoric aligns with the official GOP platform which calls for a strong economy and spending restraint to pay down the national debt but since then Trump's views may have changed his most recent economic plans include one trillion dollars in infrastructure as well as five trillion dollars in tax cuts and they could increase debt by anywhere from five point three to eleven point five trillion dollars he's also said that the US will never have to default because it can simply print money how Trump will choose to deal with the debt is a big question and only time will tell if his actions will make America great again for more quality content on business and investing like and subscribe to our youtube channel,"Politics, Economy, Debt, Government, Policy",,,,,,,,"Political, Economical"
52,The Risky Business of Public Pensions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcFih7Wv9WE&list=RDCMUCFKrfZXPHx5URnspnfM8lpQ&index=2,bcFih7Wv9WE,state and local governments all around the country have failed to set aside enough money to pay for the pensions they've promised to workers in the public sector state and local pension administrators report that they're over a trillion dollars short of what's required to fully fund pensions but it's even worse than their reporting because they aren't investing in a way that completely guarantees all the money will be there for retirees in the future and since the promises they've made to future retirees must be paid what they should do instead is plan for investment returns at the risk-free rate to ensure enough money is there in the future when you calculate current unfunded pensions using the risk-free rate they're actually underfunded by more than four trillion dollars pension funds hide the debt they create by assuming that they'll achieve relatively high investment returns but the higher the rate of return they assume the less likely they'll achieve that goal over the long run state and local governments need to calculate their investments at the risk-free rate to ensure they can deliver on their promises confronting the true cost of future pension payments would force state and local governments to save more now to prevent tax increases in the future [Music] you [Music],"Pensions, Government, Finance, Investments, Retirement",,,,,,,,"Economical, Political"
